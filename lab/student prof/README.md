## 📄 Description of Files

### `index.html`
- Contains the structure of the Student Profile Web Page
- Uses semantic elements such as:
  - `<header>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<section>`
  - `<footer>`
- Includes student details, course list, hobbies, and contact information
- Contains HTML comments identifying:
  - One element styled using a **class selector**
  - One element styled using an **ID selector**

### `style.css`
- External stylesheet linked to `index.html`
- Uses the following selectors:
  - Universal selector (`*`)
  - Element selectors (`h1`, `p`)
  - Class selector (`.section-box`)
  - ID selector (`#student-name`)
  - Group selectors (`h2, h3`)
  - Descendant selectors (`.course-list li`, `.hobby-list li`)
- No inline or internal CSS is used

---

## 🔍 Inspection Task

Using the browser’s **Inspect Tool**:
- The **student name** element demonstrates styling via an **ID selector**
- The **section containers** demonstrate styling via a **class selector**

These elements are documented using HTML comments inside `index.html`.

- No internal `<style>` tags
- No JavaScript
